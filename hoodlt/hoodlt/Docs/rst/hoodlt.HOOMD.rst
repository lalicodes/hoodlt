.. _HOODLTSimulations:

Simulations with HOOMD
======================

After we build systems using HOODLT (see :ref:`HOODLTData`), we can use the output files to simulate the system we just
built. HOODLT uses HOOMD to run simulations, and has predefined many different types of simulations that can be run for
simplicity of use.

The examples below give an overview of the many kinds of simulations that can be run using HOODLT:
